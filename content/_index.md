## GET TO KNOW ME

Hi, I’m from Oklahoma City, OK, and I’m a technical lead at
<a href="https://clevyr.com" target="_blank">Clevyr</a> with well over a decade
of experience as a developer. I'm incredibly involved in [my tech community](https://techlahoma.org), and
even organize one of OKC's [largest developer meetup groups](https://www.meetup.com/OKCWebDevs/).

My favorite projects are those that are workflow-heavy involving Laravel,
Flutter, Go, Ruby, Python, SQL, Swift, Docker, CI/CD, and more. Then, I always
enjoy building a solid, responsive front-end using tools like Tailwind CSS, Vue,
and of course, vanilla JavaScript. Craft CMS is pretty neat too.

Other than coding, I like brewing a hot cup of tea, making cocktails,
longboarding, and hanging out with my wife

and sons
<a href="https://cyruskrauss.com" target="_blank">Cyrus</a> & Lucas.
