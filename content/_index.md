## GET TO KNOW ME

Hi, I’m from Oklahoma City, OK, and I’m a senior software engineer at
<a href="https://clevyr.com" target="_blank">Clevyr</a>.
My favorite projects are those that are workflow-heavy involving Laravel,
Flutter, Node.js, Go, Swift, SQL, Docker, CI/CD, and more. Then, I always
enjoy building a solid, responsive front-end using tools like Tailwind CSS, Vue, Svelte,
and my favorite: vanilla ES6 JavaScript.

Other than coding, I like brewing a hot cup of tea, making cocktails,
longboarding, learning new things, and hanging out with my wife
<a href="https://mothercodesbest.dev" target="_blank">Layla</a>
and son
<a href="https://cyruskrauss.com" target="_blank">Cyrus</a>.
