## GET TO KNOW ME

Hi, I’m from Oklahoma City, OK, and I’m a senior software engineer at
<a href="https://clevyr.com" target="_blank">Clevyr</a>.
My favorite projects are those that are workflow-heavy involving Laravel,
Flutter, JavaScript, Swift, SQL, and more. Then, I always enjoy building a solid,
responsive front-end using all the new cool-kid tools like Vue and Svelte.

Other than coding, I like brewing a hot cup of tea, making cocktails,
longboarding, learning new things, and hanging out with my wife Layla
and son
