## GET TO KNOW ME

Hi, I’m from Oklahoma City, OK, and I’m a technical lead at
<a href="https://clevyr.com" target="_blank">Clevyr</a> with well over a decade
of experience as a developer. I'm incredibly involved in
my tech community,
including organizing
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/OKCWebDevs/" target="_blank">OKC WebDevs</a>
and helping to manage <a href="https://www.meetup.com/okccoffeeandcode/" target="_blank">OKC Coffee and Code</a>.


My favorite projects are those that are workflow-heavy involving Laravel,
Vue, Tailwind CSS, SQL, Flutter, Ruby, Node, Go, Swift, Docker, CI/CD, and more.

Other than coding, I like brewing a hot cup of tea, making cocktails,
longboarding, and hanging out with my wife

and sons
<a href="https://cyruskrauss.com" target="_blank">Cyrus</a> &
<a href="https://lucaskrauss.dev" target="_blank">Lucas</a>.
