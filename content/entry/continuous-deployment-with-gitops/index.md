The world of DevOps is always changing radically - so let's keep the
conversation going and talk about one of the newest DevOps concepts
around: GitOps. Can you use Git to help continuously deploy your projects?
Let's find out.

GitOps is a new, secure, and efficient process for creating continuous
deployment pipelines, made possible thanks modern container orchestration tools
like Kubernetes. Traditionally, to configure continuous deployment, you would
need to “poke in hole” into your production application by sharing your
credentials with a third party continuous integration provider like GitHub to
trigger the deployment; with GitOps, the management of continuous deployment
shifts back to your own production platform, which will instead detect when and
how it should handle deployment. In this talk, we'll specifically use Flux - a
leading GitOps tool - to discuss specifics and a fun demo.
