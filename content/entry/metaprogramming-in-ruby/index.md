In this talk, we'll review how you can start metaprogramming in Ruby. Ruby
is a powerful language but it's more than just syntax that makes it awesome.
Ruby gives you the ability to write some really powerful code that other
languages can't do, things like modifying existing classes, accessing and
modifying private instance variables, defining methods, gaining access to
defined classes just by a string variable, and so much more, all at runtime!
