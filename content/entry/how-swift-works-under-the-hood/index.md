In this talk, we'll dig into everything that makes up the Swift programming
language. It's history, fundamental programming concepts of the language, how
it relates to Objective-C, how it runs on iOS devices, its programming
paradigm, how Swift has changed since it's inception, how Storyboard vs SwiftUI
work, and the future of Swift. No matter how talented you are with Swift, it's
always helpful to have a refresher on how the language as a whole functions
behind-the-scenes (which might answer your questions on why certain things
are the way they are!). He'll also show off a fun, simple Swift app he's been
working on for use with his new son!
