## Abstract

In this talk, we'll be breaking down how trends in coding have changed over the
past decade and beyond, and what modern developers are using these days.
We'll cover things you'd probably expect, like back-end **dev/front-end dev/a11y/devops** -
and then a bunch of other things that affect our field like **DX**, **UI/UX**,
and **how we should collaborate together**.

While there will never be a one-size-fits-all approach to development that fits
every company's needs, it's always a good idea to keep up with the state of
development as it is right now, and where it's heading.
