Prolog is really powerful; it's a neat old language that's drastically
different from just about any other language out there. It's not
functional (though it is declarative) – but if you've never seen it before,
it will really challenge how you think about programming languages. For
example, there are Sudoku solvers written using just 15 lines of Prolog!

This is a very beginner-friendly talk about Prolog – no prior experience
necessary. Together, we'll learn about facts, rules, and queries in Prolog -
the fundamental constructs that make up a Prolog script, and how you can
use them to solve some real-world problems.
