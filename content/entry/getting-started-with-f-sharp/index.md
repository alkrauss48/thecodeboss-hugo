F# is a functional programming language that runs within the .NET framework.
In this talk, we’ll learn what it means to be a functional language and how
F# ties this together with the rest of the .NET framework. Everything will be
live-coded, so you’ll get to see exactly how things work as they’re
coded out. This talk is very beginner friendly to both functional and
.NET development alike – so come join us!
