Aaron Krauss will be giving an introduction to game development using plain
JavaScript, meaning no libraries or plugins. He'll be coding out a
single-player pong game, and discussing how to take it to the next level by
turning it into a full-blown breakout game (often called brick-breaker).

This talk is very introductory - no previous experience necessary. We'll
discuss how core game mechanics work in the browser, collision detection,
the game loop, and more! At the end, heâ€™ll review some of the popular game
libraries available today, and how you can start to get your feet wet with
JavaScript game development too!
