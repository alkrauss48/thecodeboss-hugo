In this talk with Aaron Krauss, we'll explore what GraphQL is, what problems
it solves, what problems it creates, and how you can go about implementing it
in your favorite language. We'll also have a live GraphQL demo built in
Ruby â€“ which will be a great opportunity to experience Ruby if you haven't
used it yet!
