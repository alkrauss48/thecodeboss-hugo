## Abstract

Coding is for everyone, and this talk will get you super pumped up to learn and do more with it ðŸŽ‰

This talk is geared towards a younger audience, anywhere from elementary school
students through high school. It focuses on getting students excited about
coding in hopes that they'll consider it as a future profession, interest, or
hobby.

When I give this talk, I always bring a big bowl full of candy, and I throw
pieces of candy to any student who answers my questions or asks one of their
own. It really helps with engagement when candy is whizzing by you!

This talk was originally given at a middle school in Edmond, OK
in the Fall of 2024, and then again in the Spring of 2025.
