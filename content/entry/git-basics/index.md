Git Basics is a 15-episode YouTube #Shorts series that I created for OKC
WebDevs over the Git Version Control Tool. It includes entire workflows
including basic Git usage such as managing repositories, creating and pushing
commits, branching, and more – as well as how Git relates to GitHub. Check
OKC WebDevs out at https://okcweb.dev!
