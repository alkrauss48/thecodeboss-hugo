This talk was originally given at ThunderPlains Conf 2022 in Oklahoma City, OK.

In this talk, we'll be talking about prioritizing accessibility when developing
for the web. Despite what we envision, not every user is 100% comfortable as
far as mental and physical capabilities go – and there's no excuse for
ignoring that. Building an accessible product almost always leads to a much
more well-architected product – so it's a win-win.

We'll cover the tools and strategies you can use to aid users with visual,
auditory, cognitive, and motor impairments. We'll discuss contrast, colors,
content, keyboard flows, screen readers, section 508 – as well as skip menus,
the accessibility tree, hover and focus indicators, ARIA properties, and more.

There's a lot that developers and designers can do to aid users with
impairments – so let's do it!
