In this talk, Aaron will review what it's like to be a developer, his
day-to-day, when you would use different languages, some basics that all
programming languages have (variables, looping, functions, etc.), important
aspects of coding in a team environment, and then segue into an overview about
some the more common strategies of programming: object-oriented, procedural,
and functional.
