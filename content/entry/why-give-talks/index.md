This talk was originally given at the 2023 [SheCodesOKC](https://shecodesokc.org/) Public Speaking
Workshop in Oklahoma City, OK.

In this talk, we reviewed the benefits of public speaking such as:

* Teaching others
* Learning the material better yourself
* Marketing yourself
* Marketing your demographic

As well as dispelling many of the common fears of public speaking that we tell ourselves:

* Fear #1: My topic isn't good enough
* Fear #2: I'll never feel ready
* Fear #3: I'll freeze up
* Fear #4: I can't speak for 30-40 minutes
* Fear #5: I won't be able to answer questions
