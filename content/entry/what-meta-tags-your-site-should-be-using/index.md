There are tons of valuable tags you should be placing within the &#60;head&#62; tag
that can really make your site more valuable, accessible, and help showcase
it on social media platforms before people even click on links to your site.
In this talk, we're going to go through which tags you should absolutely be
placing in the &#60;head&#62; tag of your site if you want to get the maximum exposure
and shareability possible. All of these are &#60;meta&#62; tags, with the exception
of one, and the majority of them are related to how links to your site will
render when shared on various social media platforms.
