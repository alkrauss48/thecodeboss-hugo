Python and Ruby share a lot of similarities both syntactically and by design -
probably moreso than most other common languages you hear about today - but
they’re clearly different languages with different ways of doing things.

In this talk, you’ll hear Aaron Krauss (aka "The Ruby Guy") talk about how
Ruby works compared to Python. Most of the presentation will be live-coding
driven, and if you have specific questions about how Ruby works, Aaron will be
more than happy to interactively answer them and code them out. This talk will
be completely unbiased – which means you should come with that mentality in
mind as well! Neither Ruby nor Python are "better" than the other - they're
just different, and that’s what we'll be focusing on!
