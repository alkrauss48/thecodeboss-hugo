In this talk, we'll be talking about designing accessibility for the web –
from a developer's perspective! Despite what we envision, not every user is
100% flawless as far as mental and physical capabilities go – and there's no
excuse for ignoring that. Building an accessible product almost always leads
to a much more well-architected product – so it's a win-win.

We'll discuss the tools and strategies you can use to aid users with visual,
auditory, cognitive, and motor impairments. We'll discuss contrast, colors,
content, keyboard flows, screen readers, section 508 – as well as some
development concepts such as skip menus, the accessibility tree, hover and
focus indicators, ARIA properties, and more.

There's a lot that developers and designers can do to aid users with
impairments – so let's do it!
