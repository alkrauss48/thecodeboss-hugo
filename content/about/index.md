I’m Aaron Krauss, and I’m a full stack developer based out of OKC, Oklahoma.
I've been coding for well over a decade now, and I'm very actively involved in
my local tech community.
I work at
[Clevyr](https://clevyr.com) as the Technical Lead of New Development, and I’m a fan of
Laravel, Vue, Flutter, Ruby, Go, Python, JavaScript, SQL, Swift – and honestly, just about anything.

## Background

My love of coding started when I was 14 in my first high school programming
class, and I’ve become a major polyglot programmer since then. I started by
learning Visual Basic, Java, and C/C++ in school, and then went on to self-learn Ruby,
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, Shell, SQL, C#, ... the list goes on and on.

Over my career, I’ve gotten to
work on some pretty cool projects, such as big data, detailed
analytics, oil and gas, healthcare, biopharma, state and federal, games, collaboration apps,
and plenty more. You name it, I likely have some sort of experience with it.

I typically play the role of a back-end developer, working with multiple
programming paradigms in software, web, and mobile development. I prefer to
program in a Unix-based environment, utilizing the terminal heavily for
everything. My main skills here are PHP/Laravel, Ruby/Rails, Dart/Flutter, Python, Go, SQL,
NoSQL, APIs, Node.js, Git, Shell, and Vim. Boy do I love vim. I've also got a
pretty big fancy for DevOps tools like Docker, GitHub Actions, and Kubernetes.

That said, I don’t work only on the back-end; I’m incredibly comfortable with
HTML, CSS (including TailwindCSS - that's what this site uses!), and all the major JavaScript front-end frameworks (Vue, React,
Angular). I’ve also built plenty of projects using CMSs
like WordPress, CraftCMS, and more. Check out my [projects](/projects) to see
what I’ve worked on!

## My Interests

I love **tea**, and that’s putting it lightly (don't ask me how many teapots I have).
I’ve been a tea enthusiast for
nearly two decades now. My favorite high quality teas are Japanese greens and Chinese oolongs
from reputable sources, but I
have nothing against plain 'ol tea bags too. Tea is for everyone.

I love **longboarding**. I got into it in college as a quick way to get between
classes, and I just fell in love with it. I don’t do any fancy tricks; I just
enjoy cruising, carving down hills, and getting rid of any stress from the day.

I love **craft beer** and making **cocktails**. If you’ve seen
[My History with Beer](/2015/12/my-history-with-beer/),
then you know beer is a part of my heritage. I was born in Germany, after all!
After I turned 21, craft beer rocketed into a full-blown passion. As far as cocktails go, I have a full at-home cocktail setup to craft whatever you can dream. It may take me 10 minutes to make a drink, but you can bet it’ll be made right!

I love my **family**. My wife [Layla](https://laylakrauss.dev) and I have been
together since 2006! She’s my partner in crime when it
comes to traveling the globe, playing tennis, bingewatching TV series, and
pretty much everything in between. She’s the sweetest, most thoughtful and
honest person I know. I can’t imagine a life without her. I love her, and
she’s an incredibly talented dietitian too! I also have two beautiful sons,
[Cyrus](https://cyruskrauss.com) and Lucas, who keep me busy
and full of love in ways that I could only ever have dreamed about.
